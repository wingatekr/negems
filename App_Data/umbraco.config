Pliny's \"Natural History\" published in 1548 goes into great depth about such procedures.  It should be pointed out that even the cutting and polishing of rough mineral specimens into a faceted gem is a form of treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">T</span>he ancient treatments described were very basic, and by today's standards almost comical.  The early procedures ranged from feeding pearls to a rooster, and letting it pass through his digestive system to improve the pearl's color, to boiling gemstones in garlic oil to aid in removing inclusions.  Although these techniques were very basic, variations of many of those antique practices are still used today, although in a more scientific manner.</p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">O</span>f all the assorted treatments, there are three basic treatments that you should know about prior to selecting a gemstone for purchase.  Heating, sealing, and irradiating are the primary methods used by the modern jewelry industry to enhance the appearance of a gem.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">HEAT TREATMENT</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">L</span>ong ago, miners discovered that if a rough piece of gem material was tossed into the fire and left overnight, the color would often improve.  Usually this color improvement was accompanied by severe heat fracturing of the stone.  They soon discovered that by placing the stones into a clay pot filled with mud, the heating and cooling process occurred gradually, and the stones were much less likely to fracture.  Today gemologists use kilns, like the furnaces used by a ceramics worker, to heat treat gems.  Computer controlled thermostats on these ovens are adjusted to bring the stone slowly up to the desired temperature, then return the temperature slowly back to normal.  In some high-tech furnaces the oxygen in the kiln is removed and replaced with special gasses to increase the range of alteration in the stone being treated.</p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">A</span>quamarines, for example, are heated to reduce the green hue in the gem, but the heating does not deepen the level of blue.  Dark blue or black sapphires are heated to lighten their color to a more pleasing shade of blue.  Pale colored amethysts are heated and turned yellow, to be sold as citrine.  Greeninsh-gray zosites are heated to turn them into Tanzanite.  All of these changes can make significant improvements in a stone's appearance, creating gems with wider market appeal.</p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">H</span>eat treating typically causes a permanent change in the stone's color, and the gem should not require any special handling on the part of the owner thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">FRACTURE FILLING</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">T</span>he sealing of a gem is an attempt to fill tiny cavities or cracks that break the surface of the polished stone.  In earlier times sealing was done with grease or wax, and then later with natural hardening oils, such as the oils used to finish wood furniture.  Of these early treatments the only one still used in any significant measure today is oiling, a process which is still widely used on emeralds.  Advanced sealing methods came into use when the dental industry began to use epoxy sealers on teeth to help prevent cavities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">H</span>igh-tech, epoxy sealers are relatively durable, and can be used to fill larger cracks or craters on a stone's surface. The typical method is to place the stones in an epoxy liquid, then pressurize the container to drive the epoxy deep into the cracks.  After removing the stone from the epoxy the surface is wiped clean, then painted with the catalyst to harden the epoxy which remains in the cracks or crevices of the stone.   These pressurized treatments can make dramatic improvements in the clarity of a gem, and in the case of emeralds, to create desirable gems, at affordable prices.  In the case of lapis and turquoise, without some type of surface sealer these stones would be of marginal use in jewelry -- they could easily become stained by even hand soap or lotions if used for jewelry in their unsealed form.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">IRRADIATION</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">I</span>rradiation is the treatment which has no ancient history in the gem world.  The use of linear accelerators operated by scientists can make complete changes in a stone's color.  Blue topaz is mined from the ground in either a clear, or undesirable brown color.  After some possible heating, the topaz material is irradiation treated and turned into one of several shades of blue.  Near colorless Kunzite can be turned into intense hot pink colors, and tourmalines into vivid shades of red or pink.  On some gems the effects of irradiation treatment may not be permanent. In the case of kunzite, exposure to direct sunlight for several weeks can turn a vivid colored stone back into a near colorless gem.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">SURFACE COLORING</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">O</span>ne last treatment you should know about is surface coloring.  Lapis, turquoise, pearls and some additional opaque gems can be dyed to deepen, or change their color. &amp;nbps;Diffusion treatment, the melting of a thin color layer onto the surface of colorless sapphire, can result in a gem of fine appearance, but with a clear center. A small chip or scratch in these diffusion stone reveals their clear center.</p>\n<p><span class=\"firstLetterBlue\">D</span>on't always expect your gem sales person to be fully knowledgeable of, or completely willing to disclose the variety of treatments a gem may have experienced.  An informed buyer is the best customer.</p>",

A natural pearl is formed without human intervention.  A cultured pearl is formed when a pearl farmer places a foreign substance in an oyster, and keeps the oyster in a confined farm area.<br /><br />Irregular shaped pearls can be a natural pearl, or a keshi pearl. Keshi pearls are formed when the oyster spits out the human implanted nucleus before the culturing process is complete. Keshi pearls come from both saltwater and freshwater environments. Keshis are generally small in size.  Natural pearls are also rarely round in shape because there was no round shaped nucleus implanted to help shape the finished pearl. Keshis come in a wide variety of colors.  They tend to have high luster and orient due to their solid nacre composition.<br /><br />Japan has long been the leading producer of akoya pearls, which are round pearls cultured in an Akoya oyster. For over 100 years Japanese akoya pearls have been known for their high quality. Recently Akoya oysters have been transplanted to several other nations, and Akoya pearls can now be produced in these non-Japanese locations. Hence,the phrase \"Japanese Akoyas\" is no longer used, since most pearl strands can combine both Chinese and Japanese Akoyas. <br /><br />In fact, the trade consensus is that it doesn't matter where Akoyas are cultured as long as their quality is high. This larger production as helped control and even lower prices, and this is great for the retail pearl buyer.  Happy pearl shopping...<br /><br /><span>Pearl phot linked from:<br />  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pearl/oysters.html</span></p>",

This is why the same diamond can go to the same lab and receive different grades – quite possibly even from the same individual grader! EGL even states on the bottom of each cert that \"Diamond grading is NOT an exact science and this report represents only the best professional OPINION of this company\" If it is just the opinion of one gemologist, why should it be so important?</span><br /><br /><span>The important thing to realize is that NOT all diamonds with the same grade are equal! If you look on the web for diamond prices you will find that the prices on a 1ct G SI1 can range from approx $5,000 to $10,000. Why is that??  If every G colored SI1 clarity was the same, then people would always buy the cheapest! </span><br /><br /></p>\n<div><u><span>A good SI1 just might be better than a bad VS2!</span></u></div>\n<p><u><span><br /></span></u><br /><span>You should ALWAYS Look at the Diamond, not the Paper certificate!  After all, you are not going to wear the paper on your finger. We have seen many instances where a cheaper priced diamond is the brighter and better appearing stone that more expensive similar sized stones.  What your eye sees and what’s discernable in a lab under a microscope are entirely different values. </span><br /><br /><span> LOOK AT THE STONE – then make your buying decision!!!</span></p>",

        <introduction><![CDATA[Pearls are a wonderful addition to a lady's jewelry box.  In today culture pearls are highly fashionable, and they never seem to go completely out of fashion.  We frequently are ask how pearls should be handled by the owner.  The Cultured Pearl Association offers this basis five-step list to the care and storage of pearls.

1. Never hang pearls. This weakens the silk threads holding the necklace together.
2. Never store your pearls in any type of plastic bag. Plastic can emit a chemical that will cause the pearl’s surface to deteriorate. 
3. Never leave your pearls near a direct source of heat (e.g., fireplace mantel, ­television set, stove).
4. Never store your pearls in a very dry room or in a safe deposit box for a long time. Pearls need a little bit of moisture or they’ll dry out.
5. Never allow your pearls to make contact with any chemicals found in household cleaners, perfumes, cosmetics, and hair-care products.

We offer this advice.  Concerning buying, your lowest prices will likely be offered by wholesalers and not from retail stores. In addition, you will get a better price by purchasing lots of stones rather than single stones. </span><br /><br /><span>You may also be able to run across gems at tag sales or flea markets, pawnshops and estate sales. Sometimes you can find gems considerably below current values. However, you must have the expertise to identify gems, be able to distinguish between natural and synthetic stones, and be prepared to do a lot of legwork. </span><br /><br /><span>Selling the gems for a profit is the second, and more difficult part of this process. Jewelry stores are a possible place to sell your gems, as are auction houses and online auctions. Note that, unless you own a business, you are not likely to get a retail price.  If you have weak sales skills, you should not invest in gems.</span><br /><br /><span>One last point of warning, if someone tells you a specific gem is a good investment, and that individual does not have a Series Seven License and is a registered investment advisor, they are in violation of The Securities and Exchange Commission laws, and subject to arrest.  </span><br /><br /><span>Buy your gems to own and enjoy.  Buy quality, buy at competitive prices.  Hopefully, when you want to sell your gems you will be able to find a willing buyer and make a buck.  However, if you want to make a real living in this trade, expect that it will probably only happen if you turn this hobby into a full time job.  Good luck.</span></p>",

Cab cut stones are usually, but not always opaque gems, while faceting is usually applied to transparent stones.</span></p>",

Russia's Ural Mountains  has produced fine gems, and the stones from Zambia and Brazil are often found of the finest levels of quality..  </span><br /><span>Brazil is by far the world's largest producer of emerald. Other sources are Afghanistan, Australia, India, Pakistan, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span><br /><br /><span>Emeralds come in a variety green intensities.  The have subtle side-tone hues of other colors, typically blur or yellow. Generally, the richer the green, the more valuable the emerald. Emerald are a 7.5 to 8 on the hardness scale, a making them suitable for jewelry, but best used in occasional wear pieces or jewelry which is not subjected to abuse, i.e., don't build a stone wall while wearing your emerald ring.</span><br /><br /><span>Emeralds usually have some inclusions.  These inclusions are called jardin in the jewelry trade. Completely clean emeralds are exceptionally rare and very expensive.  In fact completely clean emeralds should be tested as being synthetic, as clean and emerald don't ofter occur in the same gem.</span></p>\n<p><span>Like most gemstones in the market today, emeralds are usually treated in some way to remove surface flaws and enhance color. The most common (and acceptable) technique is to oil the stone with a green-tinted oil to fill in surface cracks. The oil hardens and strengthens the stone, and improves its green color as well.  Newer types of treatment are also used which can be superior to oiling.  These treatments include epoxy-type treatments to fill and strengthen the gem.</span></p>",

7</div>\n<p>A likely reason peridot has never achieved wide popularity may be due to the fact that most consumers have never seen a fine peridot.  The typical peridot jewelry piece normally is constructed with a pale, somewhat washed out, inexpensive example of this green stone.</p>\n<p>Fine peridot is a vivid, dark apple green color, and when cut to proper proportions is full of life and brilliance.  Peridot is somewhat soft, and care should be taken in its everyday wearing.  Large stones are rare, and price goes up quickly for nicer stones over five or six carats in weight.</p>\n<p>Peridot is mined in several locations, and it is typically found in areas of prior volcanic activity.  The most recent large find is in China, and quantities of gem grade material are found in Arizona.</p>\n<p>It is correct to pronounce peridot as peri-dough, as well as perri-dot, and it may also be correctly referred to as olivine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"birthstone-description September\"><img src=\"/media/1103/sept_stone.jpg?anchor=center&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=250&amp;height=250&amp;rnd=131337173030000000\" alt=\"September birthstone\" />\n<h3>September</h3>\n<div class=\"birthstone-subtitle\">S A P P H I R E |::| Mohs' Hardness 9</div>\n<p>Blue is the color most consumers associate with the sapphire branch of the corundum gem family.  However, sapphires can be found in all colors of the spectrum, with the exception of red (red corundum is called ruby).</p>\n<p>This hard, durable gem has been used by artisans in jewelry construction since the earliest days of gemstone adornment.  In its blue form, sapphires' hue can range from an ice colored, pale blue-gray, to an extremely dark blue-black.  The shade of blue most valued is called 'corn-flower blue', a soft yet intense, pure blue.  Other desired colors are yellow, purple, and pink.  Vivid colors are more desired than pastel shades.  A rare color of orange-pink mix, is called Padparadschah.</p>\n<p>Deposits are throughout Asia and Africa, with a find of high quality gems in Montana.  Natural six-rayed star stones, cut in cabochon, are often used in mens' jewelry.  Synthetic sapphires have been produced since the late 1800's.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"birthstone-description October\"><img src=\"/media/1104/oct_stone.jpg?anchor=center&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=250&amp;height=250&amp;rnd=131337173470000000\" alt=\"October birthstone\" />\n<h3>October</h3>\n<div class=\"birthstone-subtitle\">O P A L |::| Mohs' Hardness 5.5 - 6.5</div>\n<p>Possibly no stone used in jewelry manufacturing today spans such a wide range of prices as opal.  At the low end of the pricing structure is milky opal with a few small flecks of color.  These inexpensive stones are widely used in silver and light weight gold, or even gold plated jewelry.  At the other extreme and commanding top dollar are Lighting Ridge, Australian stones.  Fine examples of these gems have a dark to black crystal base, and a full range of colors displayed in random patches that seem to be suspended within the stone.  Fine Lightning Ridge stone can sell for as much as diamonds.</p>\n<p>Thin sheets of opal are sometimes glued to a base material and called 'doublets'.  If a clear cap is added to this doublet, a 'triplet' is created.  Boulder opal are when a portion of the natural ironstone base rock is left attached to the opal as it was taken from the ground.</p>\n<p>Opal is a somewhat soft stone, and care should be taken in wearing opals.  However, many antique opal jewelry pieces have survived the test of time.</p>\n<p>Primary opal sources are Australia, Mexico, and Idaho.  Also accepted as an opal birthstone substitute is Tourmaline (see June, pearl-tourmaline).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"birthstone-description November\"><img src=\"/media/1105/nov_stone.jpg?anchor=center&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=250&amp;height=250&amp;rnd=131337173880000000\" alt=\"November birthstone\" />\n<h3>November</h3>\n<div class=\"birthstone-subtitle\">T O P A Z |::| Mohs' Hardness 8</div>\n<p>The November birthstone is found naturally in many colors: yellows, pinks, oranges, browns and even colorless.  Reportedly, natural blue gems have also been mined in Russia, but the typical blue topaz found in the marketplace has been irradiated in a lab to obtain its blue coloring.</p>\n<p>Topaz is a relatively hard stone, but it has a cleavage plane which can sheer if the gem is hit hard.  Properly cut stones position this cleavage plane on an angle to minimize this possibility.  Topaz crystals are found in large sizes, and per carat price does not carry a significant premium as gem size increases.</p>\n<p>Natural crystals tend to be somewhat long in relationship to width, and polished gems are often cut in this same long-narrow fashion; well proportioned gems carry a premium price.  Citrine, a yellow quartz, is sometimes incorrectly called 'golden Topaz', but this name is misleading and should be avoided.  Major topaz mines are in Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"birthstone-description December\"><img src=\"/media/1106/dec_stone.jpg?anchor=center&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=250&amp;height=250&amp;rnd=131337174300000000\" alt=\"December birthstone\" />\n<h3>December</h3>\n<div class=\"birthstone-subtitle\">Z I R C O N |::| Mohs' Hardness 6.5 to 7.5</div>\n<p>Zircon is one of the most brilliant of all colored gems.  Colorless zircon was commonly used as an early diamond substitute, and zircon in all of its assorted natural colors has been used in jewelry since early times.</p>\n<p>The natural colors of the stone are honey yellow, orange, red, and various shades of green and blue.  Less desired brownish colors are often heated to turn them colorless or blue, with some of these shades possibly reverting back to their natural color if exposed to strong UV light.</p>\n<p>The stone is somewhat brittle, and the girdle edges of the stone are easily damaged.  Despite these drawbacks, zircon is a beautiful, brilliant gem, and makes wonderful jewelry.  Deposits of the stone are primarily in southern Asia</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</ins></div>",

<p>Colors can range from colorless to a near black deep burgundy, and from bright red to deep green.  Rare, green colored demantoid garnets are quite costly, while brownish-red almandine garnets are very affordable.  Garnets are found throughout the world, with significant U.S. deposits in Idaho and North Carolina.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Of all the various colors of quartz gemstones, the purple color of amethyst is the most highly prized.  Folklore holds that amethyst helps in overcoming homesickness, and when worn, helps in preventing drunkenness.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, and up through the 1920's, the shade of amethyst most favored in jewelry was a pale lavender shade known as rose of France.  In recent times the fashion trend has been to use a deep purple colored gem.</p>
<p>The purple color saturation can, however, become so dense as to make the stone overly dark, causing the stone to lose brilliance.  Amethyst is a hard stone, suitable for use in everyday jewelry, and its moderate price adds to its consumer appeal.  In the United States the finer stones are mined in Arizona, with better quality foreign sources in Brazil, Africa and Russia.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Aquamarine is so named because of its resemblance to the color of sea water.  In its natural crystal form it has a pale to deep blue coloring, often with a slight greenish tint.  Lighter colored stones typically are heated to remove the green component of their color.  Recently, the desirability of natural greenish-blue colored stones has increased.  Aquamarine is found in large crystals and is one of the few gems that does not seem to increase in per carat price as size goes up.  Smaller, three-to-five carat stones of fine color can bring premium prices.  Aqua, as it is often called, is a talisman for sailors, and was carried aboard most early sailing vessels voyaging into uncharted waters.  A member of the beryl group of stones, aqua can easily be confused with blue topaz, a less expensive stone.</p>
<p>Aqua is found worldwide, with North American deposits in Colorado and California, as well as several other states.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The name diamond comes from the ancient Greek word, Adamas, or unconquerable.  It is the hardest of all gems, ranking 10 on the Mohs' Hardness Scale (a listing of comparative gemstone hardness).  A diamond's brilliance, hardness and durability, along with good marketing and promotion, have made diamonds the most sought after gemstone in the world today.</p>
<p>There are significant diamond deposits in South Africa and Siberia, and a recent find in Australia.  Diamonds have been discovered and commercially mined on a small scale in Canada, and the state of Colorado.  It has been reported that a diamond miner must dig approximately one ton of rock for every half carat of diamond found.  Color grading of diamonds starts with the letter 'D' as the finest grade of white, and progresses through the alphabet as tint levels increase.  Clarity, signifying the level of inclusions in the gem, begins as Flawless, and moves through VVS, to VS, to SI to I or included grades.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Desired even in Biblical times, the emerald is one of the oldest known gemstones.  This green member of the beryl gem family has been found in ancient tombs, royal treasuries, and even in sunken sailing ships.  The most prized stones are usually associated with the Muzo mine in Columbia, but extremely fine gems also come from Zambia in Africa, and from a few specific mines in Brazil.</p>
<p>The finest Colombian stones typically have a slight bluish cast to their color, while the Zambian stones are noted for their clarity, or minimal amount of inclusions.  Virtually all emeralds have some inclusions, and gemologists agree that if the emerald under observation is inclusion free, it's likelihood of being genuine is highly suspect.</p>
<p>While emeralds are relatively hard and durable, they are somewhat brittle and can be damaged with hard impact.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In today's retail market two stones are normally offered as the birthstone for June.  Pearls have long been the gem identified with this month, but since the 1960's pink Tourmaline has gained acceptance as an additional birthstone for June.  (Alexandrite is sometimes listed as June's birthstone, but its rarity and cost make alexandrite an unlikely choice for most consumers.)</p>
<p>Pearl necklaces have been a staple in women's jewelry for many years.  Stud earrings, pins, pendants and rings are all found set with pearls.  Recently the Japanese hold on cultured pearl manufacturing has been challenged by both the Americans and the Chinese.</p>
<p>The second June gem, Pink Tourmaline, is mined in gem grades in California and Maine, as well as Brazil, Africa, and other countries.  Hot pink and pastel pink colors of tourmaline are often used in designer jewelry pieces, as their cost and durability make them an excellent choice.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The term 'Burma Ruby' has been used for years to describe the finest grades of ruby, the common name for red corundum.  The Burma term came into use when most all of the world's finest rubies were mined in Burma (now Myanmar).  Fine rubies are also mined in Thailand and East Africa.  Thai stones typically are somewhat more purple in color, and the African gems are somewhat more brownish than Burma rubies.  It should be noted, however, a top gem grade stone can come from any geographic location.</p>
<p>Rubies are second in hardness to diamonds, and as such they are extremely durable in everyday wear.  Large, fine stones are rare, and synthetic varieties have been manufactured since the late 1800's.  This red gem is one of the most expensive colored stones, and price escalates quickly with size.   Rubies are often mounted with diamonds to enhance their red color, but a fine ruby has enough of a visual impact to make it an excellent stand alone stone.</p>]]></description>

<p>Fine peridot is a vivid, dark apple green color, and when cut to proper proportions is full of life and brilliance.  Peridot is somewhat soft, and care should be taken in its everyday wearing.  Large stones are rare, and price goes up quickly for nicer stones over five or six carats in weight.</p>
<p>Peridot is mined in several locations, and it is typically found in areas of prior volcanic activity.  The most recent large find is in China, and quantities of gem grade material are found in Arizona.</p>
<p>It is correct to pronounce peridot as peri-dough, as well as perri-dot, and it may also be correctly referred to as olivine.</p>]]></description>

<p>This hard, durable gem has been used by artisans in jewelry construction since the earliest days of gemstone adornment.  In its blue form, sapphires' hue can range from an ice colored, pale blue-gray, to an extremely dark blue-black.  The shade of blue most valued is called 'corn-flower blue', a soft yet intense, pure blue.  Other desired colors are yellow, purple, and pink.  Vivid colors are more desired than pastel shades.  A rare color of orange-pink mix, is called Padparadschah.</p>
<p>Deposits are throughout Asia and Africa, with a find of high quality gems in Montana.  Natural six-rayed star stones, cut in cabochon, are often used in mens' jewelry.  Synthetic sapphires have been produced since the late 1800's.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Possibly no stone used in jewelry manufacturing today spans such a wide range of prices as opal.  At the low end of the pricing structure is milky opal with a few small flecks of color.  These inexpensive stones are widely used in silver and light weight gold, or even gold plated jewelry.  At the other extreme and commanding top dollar are Lighting Ridge, Australian stones.  Fine examples of these gems have a dark to black crystal base, and a full range of colors displayed in random patches that seem to be suspended within the stone.  Fine Lightning Ridge stone can sell for as much as diamonds.</p>
<p>Thin sheets of opal are sometimes glued to a base material and called 'doublets'.  If a clear cap is added to this doublet, a 'triplet' is created.  Boulder opal are when a portion of the natural ironstone base rock is left attached to the opal as it was taken from the ground.</p>
<p>Opal is a somewhat soft stone, and care should be taken in wearing opals.  However, many antique opal jewelry pieces have survived the test of time.</p>
<p>Primary opal sources are Australia, Mexico, and Idaho.  Also accepted as an opal birthstone substitute is Tourmaline (see June, pearl-tourmaline).</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The November birthstone is found naturally in many colors: yellows, pinks, oranges, browns and even colorless.  Reportedly, natural blue gems have also been mined in Russia, but the typical blue topaz found in the marketplace has been irradiated in a lab to obtain its blue coloring.</p>
<p>Topaz is a relatively hard stone, but it has a cleavage plane which can sheer if the gem is hit hard.  Properly cut stones position this cleavage plane on an angle to minimize this possibility.  Topaz crystals are found in large sizes, and per carat price does not carry a significant premium as gem size increases.</p>
<p>Natural crystals tend to be somewhat long in relationship to width, and polished gems are often cut in this same long-narrow fashion; well proportioned gems carry a premium price.  Citrine, a yellow quartz, is sometimes incorrectly called 'golden Topaz', but this name is misleading and should be avoided.  Major topaz mines are in Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka.</p>]]></description>
